# CPAutoMiner
New Club Penguin auto miner.
Click once at the TOP LEFT most corner of the mine floor.
Then click once at the BOTTOM RIGHT most corner of the mine floor.
The miner will start up after a 5 second countdown.
To stop the program use "CTRL + C" or "CTRL + Break" to stop the program

latest change(4/18/22)
Added new efficiency check. The program will find a suitable location ot mine base on color of the ground it wishes to move to before moving.
This will allow the user to select a larger portion of the screen to use more mineing space. This will also help prevent from clicking and moving to
non-minable ground and help click on other players less often. I still suggest before starting, click on your penquin and drag your player card to the 
bottom left or right of the screen. This is so that if it does manage to click on a player, the card does not open in the middle of the screen and cover
up mining space.

Yes I know Im sure there are better ways to write this program but I really dont care I made it for fun and for personal use. 
Feel free to edit your own version to however you like.


TODO:
--- Start of program gives base instructions on where to click and what was clicked.
--- Make option to bot coffee making (7 times)
--- Fix program fails to run if selecting bottom left and then top right.
